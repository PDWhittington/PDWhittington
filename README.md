# About me

My name is Phil Whittington. I am a developer in London working in financial IT. I work for a consultancy called [FD Technologies](https://fdtechnologies.com/).

One of my new year's resolutions for 2022 is to kickstart a few open source projects. The first is [todo](https://github.com/PDWhittington/todo), which I'm describing as an 'an idiosyncratic todo list manager'. 

I have a personal project which requires the acquisition of accurate timestamps. I have open-sourced the timestamp component as [fast-time](https://github.com/PDWhittington/fast-time). Sadly this is Windows-only at present.

Over the course of the year I am aiming to start work on a few other ideas, including:-

* A wave file sequencer which applies noise reduction.
* Errr, some other things to be fleshed out in due course.
